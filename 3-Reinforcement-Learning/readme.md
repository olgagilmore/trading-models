The Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent Project designs, encodes, and trains a trading agent from scratch using reinforcement learning (RL). The key concepts of RL are agents, environments, actions, states, and rewards.
The project uses Python & Tensorflow, and involves the architecture and mechanics of DQN ( Deep Q-Networks (DQN)), a popular RL algorithm used for training trading agents.
Here, I design effective reward functions that guides the agent towards profitable trading strategies.
It shows the practical experience in encoding and training a trading agent, including handling data, optimizing the DQN model via experience replay, and interpreting the training process output.
