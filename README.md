### **Project 1 – Financial Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

**Description:**
Developed robust data pipelines to clean, align, and normalize historical stock and index data from multiple sources. Applied feature engineering techniques such as rolling averages, volatility measures, and momentum indicators to enhance model predictive power.

**Tech stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, yFinance API
**Skills:** Time-series alignment, feature creation, handling missing data, exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### **Project 2 – Risk-Parity Portfolio Analysis & Predictive Modeling**

**Description:**
Researched and tested alpha factors to predict relative stock performance using Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees. Used cross-validation to ensure generalization and avoid overfitting.
**Impact:** Demonstrated improvement over baseline models in predicting next-day returns.

**Tech stack:** Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
**Skills:** Machine learning, factor modeling, cross-validation, model evaluation

### **Project 3 – Portfolio Optimization**

**Description:**
Built an optimized portfolio using the **Efficient Frontier** approach to balance expected return and risk. Incorporated constraints on leverage and asset allocation.
**Impact:** Created a risk-adjusted portfolio that outperformed a simple equal-weight benchmark in backtests.

**Tech stack:** Python, CVXOPT, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
**Skills:** Modern Portfolio Theory, Sharpe ratio optimization, constraint handling

### **Project 4 – Trading Strategy Backtesting**

**Description:**
Implemented a backtesting engine to evaluate factor-based trading strategies. Simulated realistic market conditions including transaction costs and slippage.
**Impact:** Validated strategies over multiple time periods and market regimes.

**Tech stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy
**Skills:** Backtesting, performance metrics, risk management

### **Project 5 – Event-Driven Trading Simulator**

**Description:**
Developed an event-driven framework that processes market events (price updates, signals, orders) in real time to simulate live trading. Integrated with factor signals to trigger buy/sell decisions.
**Impact:** Demonstrated practical execution of alpha factors in a realistic trading environment.

**Tech stack:** Python, object-oriented programming, Pandas
**Skills:** Event-driven architecture, order management, simulation design
