The S&P 500 (Standard & Poor's 500) is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It is widely regarded as one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market and economy. Over the long term, the S&P 500 has shown consistent growth, making it a key focus for long-term investors. However, it can also experience significant volatility in the short term.

In this project, I attempt to build a momentum-based strategy to trade the S&P 500 index. 
I use the python packages numpy, scipy and sqlite3, among others, in this project.
